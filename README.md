# Peg Solver
The peg puzzle is a game that involves a grid of pegs.  A peg can jump over another peg and the peg that was jumped over will be removed.  In order to win you need to continue to jump pegs until you are only left with a single peg.
		
This solver allows you to enter in a game board that is comprised of pegs and walls.  It will then attempt to solve your puzzle by going through all possible options.
